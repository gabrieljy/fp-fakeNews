Other things I may wanna include – 
“A systematic literature review & existing challenges toward fake news detection models” - https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13278-022-00995-5 (to discuss techniques/methods - specifically, LSTM/CNN have shown competitive performance in analysing linguistic features of news articles. BERT integration also noted for superior performance in classification tasks)
